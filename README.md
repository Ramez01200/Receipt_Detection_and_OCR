📸 **Receipt Detection and OCR: Transforming Chaos into Order** 📸

I recently embarked on an exciting journey to tackle a common problem we all face: deciphering messy receipts! 🧾

Here's how I turned chaos into a structured table of items, prices, and taxes:

1. **Yolov8 for Receipt Detection**:
   - Armed with the powerful Yolov8 model, I trained it to spot receipts in images. It's like having a digital detective that can identify those crumpled pieces of paper hiding in your photos! 🕵️‍♂️

2. **Tesseract: The Text Extractor**:
   - Next, I enlisted Tesseract, the trusty OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool. It diligently extracted text from the detected receipts. Imagine it as a language-savvy robot reading those faded ink scribbles! 🤖

3. **Customizing the Chaos**:
   - But wait, there's more! I didn't stop there. I meticulously parsed the extracted text to create a neat table. Each row represented an item, its price, and the applicable tax. 📊

4. **The Magic of Automation**:
   - Now, whenever I snap a receipt, my code springs into action. It identifies the items, calculates the total, and even factors in the tax. No more manual data entry—just pure automation magic! 🎩✨

5. **Why This Matters**:
   - Imagine the impact! Businesses can automate expense tracking, individuals can organize their spending, and accountants can breathe a sigh of relief. Plus, it's eco-friendly—fewer paper receipts cluttering our lives! 🌱

6. **Join the Journey**:
   - I'm thrilled to share my project on GitHub: Receipt_Detection_and_OCR. Feel free to explore, contribute, or even use it for your own adventures! 🌟

7. **Seeking Opportunities**:
   - As I continue my coding odyssey, I'm open to exciting job opportunities. If you're looking for someone who can turn chaos into order, let's connect! 🤝
